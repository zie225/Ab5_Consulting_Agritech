Studies on modeling and optimizing the use of sensors, to achieve the best results for farmers. the objective here is to find the best sensor at low cost for smallholders but depending on the type of soil. We use raspberry pi and the 4 channel 16 bit ADC microship for calibration and instrumentation.
